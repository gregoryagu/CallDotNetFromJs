This is a simple sample to show a feature whereby if a javascript is imported in the code-behind, it will automatically be downloaded by Blazor. In other words, no script tag with a src property needs to be used.

Run the sample, then open  the browser console window, then navigate to CallDotNet1.  CallDotNet1.razor.js will be automatically downloaded at that time.
